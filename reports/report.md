# Introduction

This project focuses on building a recommender system using the MovieLens 100K dataset. 
The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts user preferences for movies, leveraging user ratings, 
demographic data, and movie information.

# Data Analysis

The dataset comprises three main components: user data, movie ratings, and movie information. 

- **User Data**: Consists of user demographics including age and gender, along with a list of occupations. Gender data is binary encoded into 'male' and 'female' columns.
- **Movie Ratings**: Includes user ratings for movies on a scale, providing a direct measure of user preferences.
- **Movie Information**: Contains details about movies, such as titles and release years. The release year is extracted from the release date for simplicity.

Each component has been preprocessed and transformed into a more usable format. 
Timestamps in ratings and redundant information in movie details (like URLs) are removed to streamline the data.

# Model Implementation

The recommender system is implemented using a graph neural network (GNN) architecture, designed to handle the intricate and interrelated data of users and movies. The model consists of three main components:

1. **Graph Attention Network Encoder (GNNEncoder)**: This encoder uses two layers of Graph Attention Network v2 (GATv2) convolution. GATv2 is an advanced variant of GAT, providing more flexible attention mechanisms. The encoder effectively captures the relationships between users and movies in the graph structure, with the absence of self-loops indicating a focus on inter-node (user-item) relationships. Each layer transforms the node features, with the first layer incorporating a ReLU activation function for non-linearity.

2. **Edge Decoder (EdgeDecoder)**: This component decodes the learned node embeddings to predict the edge labels (i.e., ratings). It concatenates user and item embeddings and processes them through two linear layers with a ReLU activation in between. The final output is a single value representing the predicted rating, achieved by reshaping the output of the second linear layer.

3. **Overall Model**: The model integrates the encoder and decoder. The encoder is adapted to heterogeneous graphs (graphs with different types of nodes and edges) using the `to_hetero` method, which allows the model to handle user and item nodes distinctly but in a unified framework. The decoder is then used to predict the ratings based on the encoded features. During training, dropout is applied to the edges to regularize the model and prevent overfitting.

The model is defined with a specific number of hidden channels (32 in this case) which determines the size of the embeddings. It is then placed on the appropriate computational device (e.g., GPU) for efficient training.

An optimizer, specifically Adam, is used with a learning rate of 0.001. This optimizer is well-suited for this kind of task due to its adaptive learning rate capabilities, which help in converging to the optimal solution efficiently.

# Model Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages:
- Tailored user experience by considering individual preferences and demographic data.
- Scalability of the neural network to handle large datasets.

Disadvantages:
- Potential for overfitting due to the model's complexity.
- Dependence on the quality and quantity of the data for accurate recommendations.

# Training Process

The training process involves feeding the model with user and movie data, 
and optimizing it based on the ratings provided. Key aspects include splitting the data into training and validation sets, 
choosing an appropriate loss function, and selecting an optimizer. 
Regular evaluations during training help in fine-tuning the model's parameters.

# Evaluation

Model evaluation is conducted using metrics relevant to recommender systems,
such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). 
These metrics assess the accuracy of the predicted ratings against the actual ratings.

# Results

The results section would detail the model's performance on the test dataset. 
It would include a discussion on the achieved accuracy, areas where the model excels, 
and potential areas for improvement. 
Visualizations like confusion matrices or error distributions can provide deeper insights into the model's behavior.
